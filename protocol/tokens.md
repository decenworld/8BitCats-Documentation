{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that CATCOIN **actively pegs via an algorithm**, it **does not mean** it will be valued at 1 CATCOIN: 1 USDC at all times as it is not collateralized. CATCOIN is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stable coin.

CAT Shares (CSHARES) are a way to measure the value of the CATCOIN Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain the value of CATCOIN Dollar close to its peg to the US dollar. During epoch expansions, the CATCOIN Protocol mints new CATCOIN and distributes it proportionally to all CATSHARE holders who have staked their tokens in the boardroom. This allows CATSHARE holders to earn rewards for their support of the protocol and for the protocol to distribute its value to its stakeholders.
