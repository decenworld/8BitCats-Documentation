# 💰 How to Provide Liquidity

When you have bought CATCOIN and/or CATSHARE, head over to the Liquidity tab in SpookySwap located in the left side on the menu. Now you have to choose Ingredient A and Ingredient B.\
\
Ingredient A must either be CATCOIN or CATSHARE and ingredient B must be USDC. Note that ingredients A & B must be equal in value (SpookySwap will automatically calculate this for you) When you have selected both ingredients click on supply and accept the transaction. You should now have a LP Token in your wallet. \

## Yield farming through staking

In order to earn daily rewards through yield farming, you need to stake your LP Token in 8bitcats website here:\ - [https://www.8bitcats.com/farms](https://www.8bitcats.com/farms)
\
Choose either CATCOINS-USDC LP or CATSHARE-USDC LP, depending which pool you provided liquidity for.\
Then you need to approve the contract and thereafter you can stake your LP token by pressing the '+' button. Your LP token is now staked and you can enjoy daily reward returns in CATSHARE (the amount depends on the APR shown in the pool you are staked in).\
\
As you are earning staking rewards, you should consider compounding your fees, meaning claim your CATSHARE rewards and stake it in the Boardroom:\
- [https://www.8bitcats.com/boardroom](https://www.8bitcats.com/boardroom)\
The Boardroom only prints new CATCOINS if TWAP is over 1.01. TWAP is listed in the Boardroom page.\
\
If TWAP is under 1.01, it will not print CATCOINS, therefore do not stake your CATSHARE here. Instead swap your CATSHARES for CATCOINS, to help CATCOIN reach Peg to 1 USDC. If you don't want to swap all of your CATSHARES for CATCOINS, you can provide liquidity with the remaining CATSHARES by supplying it with USDC and make a new LP token and stake in in the farm. If you don't have any USDC, you can sell 50% of your CATSHARE for USDC and provide LP that way.\
\
Here is a method to keep the protocol healthy: (Only if TWAP is over 1.01, meaning CATCOIN is over PEG)
* Step 1: Provide CATCOINS-USDC liquidity in farm
* Step 2: Claim CATSHARE rewards from CATCOINS-USDC LP pool
* Step 3: Stake claimed CATSHARE rewards into the Boardroom
* Step 4: Claim the CATCOINS rewards from the Boardroom
* Step 5: Supply new CATCOINS-USDC LP with claimed CATCOIN
* Step 6: Stake new Catcoin-USDC LP into farm
* Step 7: Rinse repeat. 
\
If TWAP is under 1.01, you should buy CATCOINS to help it reach Peg and maintain a TWAP over 1.01\
